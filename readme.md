Inflection of Latvian nouns
---------------------------

[loc.php](loc.php) contains code (old as the world, of course), which can inflect Latvian nouns, given their
nominative case in singular, and gender.

Pupiņvaloda
-----------

Script [pup.php](pup.php) converts Latvian text to so called "pupiņvaloda". It has simple rules, but helps children
to train diction.
