Misc stuff, I've acquired over the years
========================================

This repository contains miscellania, I've done or acquired over the years.

Inflection of Latvian nouns
---------------------------

loc.php contains code (old as the world, of course), which can inflect Latvian nouns, given their
nominative case in singular, and gender.

Pupiņvaloda
-----------

Script converts Latvian text to so called "pupiņvaloda". It has simple rules, but helps children
to train diction.
